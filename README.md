# A Deep Learning - Source Codes ðŸš€

This repository serves as a central hub for the code and resources following a series of deep learning tutorials I write on my blog. 

The goal is to provide practical, hands-on examples to solidify the understanding of core deep learning concepts.

## About The Project

This project is born from the idea of creating a well-organized and ever-growing collection of deep learning tutorials which I write in my personal blog and put the codes here. 

Each tutorial is designed to be a deep dive into a specific topic, breaking down complex stuff into understandable and applicable code.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your_repository
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4. Please note that since I'm writing tutorials on different things some codes might require different libraries. Therefore, the `requirements.txt` might not be up to date. Sorry about that.

## Tutorials

Here you'll find a curated list of in-depth tutorials.

### The Convolution Operation

> It's essential to understand, or at least have some knowledge of, the convolution operation's workings and nature to comprehend Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Convolution itself is a core mathematical operation, integral to various domains including signal processing, image processing, and particularly deep learning. The true power of the convolution operation lies in its ability to offer a robust means of observing and characterizing physical systems. Let's examine the mechanics of this operation!

-   **Code:**
    -   `scripts/convolution/1d_convolution.py`
    -   `scripts/convolution/2d_convolution.py`

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) - Keras Implementation (using Spektral) 

> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamentals of GNNs and introduce you to `Spektral`, a Python library for building graph neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.

### JAXing Up Your Machine Learning

> While frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have revolutionized AI development, they often come with a certain rigidity and verbosity. Enter JAX, Google's high-performance numerical computing library that's shaking things up. At least, according to the experts! JAX is a toolkit built on NumPy, designed for high-performance numerical computation and machine learning research.
