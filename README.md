## About The Project

This project is born from the idea of creating a well-organized and ever-growing collection of deep learning tutorials. Each tutorial is designed to be a deep dive into a specific topic, breaking down complex theories into understandable and applicable code.

***

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your_repository
    ```
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Tutorials

Here you'll find a curated list of in-depth tutorials.

### The Convolution Operation

It's essential to understand, or at least have some knowledge of, the convolution operation's workings and nature to comprehend Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Convolution itself is a core mathematical operation, integral to various domains including signal processing, image processing, and particularly deep learning. The true power of the convolution operation lies in its ability to offer a robust means of observing and characterizing physical systems. Let's examine the mechanics of this operation!

    -   `scripts/convolution/2d_convolution.py`

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning methods designed to perform inference on data described by graphs. This tutorial will guide you through the fundamentals of GNNs and introduce you to `Spektral`, a powerful Python library for building graph neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras.
